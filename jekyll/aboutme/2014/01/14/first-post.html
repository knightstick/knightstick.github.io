        <h2>Beginning my journey into coding</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Chris, I&#39;m a Maths Graduate from Liverpool in the UK, and I&#39;ve recently moved to Melbourne, Australia. I&#39;ve decided that 2014 is the year that I learn to code, program, develop websites and all that jazz, and to that end, I&#39;m using this post to commit to this in a concrete way, and hopefully some of you may want to follow my progress.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>I graduated university a couple of years ago, and, since then, have mostly been working in bars. I&#39;ve met some amazing friends and had some great times, but, there&#39;s always been a voice at the back of my head complaining that I&#39;m not working to the best of my abilities. My brother is a Software Engineer in London and has always encouraged me to explore his area of expertise. I know that it is an area that I&#39;d be interested in and challenged by, and hopefully, eventually, better financially recompensated by than working in bars... Over the next few months or so, I aim to foray into this world and see how much I can learn, and what I can accomplish!</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been learning bits and pieces about Web Development, Coding, Programming and Computer Science for a while now, but have very limited experience in actually making a finished project. I&#39;ve had a go with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C, Ruby and Python, but tend only to have made little standalone pieces. <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" title="Codecademy">Codecademy</a>, <a href="http://www.codewars.com" title="Codewars">Codewars</a>, the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org" title="Mozilla Developer Network">Mozilla Developer Network</a> and <a href="http://www.edxorg" title="edX">edX</a> have all been very useful to me, and I&#39;ve enjoyed the Computer Science courses I&#39;ve looked at online. But, now it&#39;s time to actually do something!</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>The best way to learn is by doing, or, that&#39;s what people tell me. Because of that, I&#39;m going to just get stuck in making things and deal with the particular obstacles as I come along them. To that end, I&#39;m writing this in &quot;Markdown&quot;, a simple language that I have never used before... </p>

<h2>Markdown</h2>

<p>Markdown is a &quot;text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers&quot;, and, whilst I write this, I&#39;m still unsure how I go from this easy to write plain text into an actual page on the actual internet, but, staying true to my &quot;learn by doing&quot; mantra, I&#39;ll deal with that when I get to it. At this moment, I&#39;m simply writing in a text editor using the syntax for Markdown which I&#39;m learning from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="daringfireball.net">daringfireball.net</a>.</p>

<p>I have a bit of background in HTML, I created and maintained a website for my first ever band (when I was 15), but, things have changed a lot since then. (What do you mean people don&#39;t use frames anymore?!) The benefits of Markdown, as far as I&#39;ve gathered thusfar, is that it takes out the &quot;tag&quot; nature of HTML and uses a much more straightforward plain text formatting that is easy to understand.</p>

<p>Readability of Markdown is emphasized above all else, and so it makes it a natural syntax to choose for writing for the web. It is composed entirely of punctuation characters which means that a Markdown document is readable by the layman, which makes it a great place for me to start getting my teeth stuck in!</p>

<h2>The Next Step</h2>

<p>So, now I have a document in Markdown syntax, my next step is to actually get it online. After that, my journey has officially started, so, we&#39;ll see what happens from then on! </p>
