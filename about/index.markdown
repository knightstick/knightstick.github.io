# About me

Hi, my name is Chris, I'm a Maths Graduate from Liverpool in the UK, and I've recently moved to Melbourne, Australia. I've decided that 2014 is the year that I learn to code, program, develop websites and all that jazz, and to that end, I'm using this post to commit to this in a concrete way, and hopefully some of you may want to follow my progress.

My aim is to "learn by doing" and document my fumbled attempts towards web dominance. Expect mis-starts, backfires and epiphany moments. There may well be tears, joy and some strong language. If it all goes well, I may walk around the room with both hands high in the air, the universal sign-language for "I am totally awesome."
