        <h2>Long live the jazz</h2>

<p>Last time I made a &quot;dummy&quot; site skeleton in HTML in order to inform my decisions when it comes to creating a fully-functional, easily-updatable Jekyll website.</p>

<p>Next step, use some CSS to jazz things up a bit!</p>

<h2>Normalize.css</h2>

<p>The way different browsers disply the same web page can be very different, escpecially on older browsers, so, in order to start my page off on a level footing, I&#39;m using a CSS sheet called &quot;Normalize.css&quot;. This is an open source CSS file that &quot;makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.&quot; You can read more about it <a href="http://git.io/normailize">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Laying it out there</h2>

<p>At first, I&#39;ve decided to make a site with an inherent width, that, when the window is WIDER than the content, centres itself in the middle of the browser. Everntually I plan on investigating the new @media rules in order to have a site that responds to different browser widths and looks good on other devices (such as phones and tablets), but for now, this will do for my needs.</p>

<h3>Box-Sizing</h3>

<p>I started by defining the following bit of CSS on *, the universal selector. This means it is applied to every element of the page (unless overwritten with higher precedence later on in the stylesheet.)</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="css"><span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">webkit</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">box</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">sizing</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">border</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">box</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">moz</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">box</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">sizing</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">border</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">box</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">box</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">sizing</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">border</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">box</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Effectively, this makes each element behave more like you would expect (or, it feels more intuitive to me) when changing margins, padding etc. The browser-specific properties help to future-proof the CSS, so that if it is not fully supported yet, it will still do what you expect... mostly. </p>

<p>By setting the value to border-box, when we play around with the padding and margin, the overall size of the element doesn&#39;t change, which, for me, is very helpful in getting the layout to look the way I want.</p>

<p>With all this in place, we can work towards getting the elements to sit where we want, and behave the way we want around each other. The way I want my page to behave is to have a fixed width section that centres itself on wide screens. For an element to do this, we can our CSS like so:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html">.main {
    width: 1000px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>This sets a fixed width on my div with the class &quot;main&quot;, and, using a bit of shorthand, sets the top and bottom margins to zero, and the left and right margins to &quot;auto&quot;; this effectively gets the div to sit in the centre of the window, as we would like.</p>

<p>Rather than adding these properties to all my sections of content, I&#39;ve defined them on a class called &quot;center-global&quot; and then added this class to any element I want to have these properties (like the header, main section and footer). This saves me from having the </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html">width: 1000px;
margin: 0 auto;
</code></pre></div>

<p>repeated throughout the stylesheet.</p>

<h3>Aside</h3>

<p>I realise that I&#39;m going backwards and forwards between the UK and US spelling of &quot;centre&quot;. I feel better writing the word in the UK spelling when using it outside of code, but, to fit in with convention (and syntax), use the US &quot;center&quot;. Probably just pedantic to use &quot;centre&quot; as well, but hey...</p>

<h2>Overall structure</h2>

<p>The way I structured my HTML was to put extra divs inside of the header, main and footer elements, and then set these INSIDE elements to centre themselves. In this way, the &quot;header&quot; element stretches the entire width of the screen, but, the inside div has a fixed width and won&#39;t expand further across the screen than the width I&#39;ve set for it. This is similar in the main and footer section, effectively restricting the width of the content, but not the page.</p>

<h2>Float on</h2>

<p>The area of CSS I&#39;ve found to be the most confusing so far is the layout, positioning and floating aspects. Occasionally everything works as I&#39;d expect, but, mostly, things blow up and appear somewhere entirely different to where I wanted them to, or, sometimes don&#39;t appear at all.</p>

<p>I imagine the more CSS layouts I work on, the more it&#39;ll come to me, but, there&#39;s something slightly mysterious about the way all the elements interact with each other that I&#39;ve not quite got a grasp on yet.</p>

<p>Having said that, in a simple website like this one, things aren&#39;t too bad. My header image (a &quot;selfie&quot; I took after losing $100 in the casino in Singapore), when set to 
&#39;float: left;&#39; nicely clears my h1 title. Similarly, after adding an image to the &quot;site intro&quot; section (an Instagram photo taken inside the aforementioned casino), it can be floated so that the text surrounds it nicely.</p>

<p>Once I tried putting background colors on various elements however, I found that not everything was working the way I expected. After some research, I found that it was due to the &quot;parent&quot; containers &quot;collapsing&quot; due to the float behaviour. </p>

<p>The following bit of code, known as a &quot;clearfix&quot;, comes to the rescue: </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="css"><span class="c">/* cf class definitions - clearfix for float problems */</span>
<span class="nc">.cf</span><span class="nd">:before</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="nc">.cf</span><span class="nd">:after</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="k">content</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">table</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nc">.cf</span><span class="nd">:after</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="k">clear</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">both</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nc">.cf</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="n">zoom</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* for IE6 and IE7 */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, I can use the &#39;cf&#39; class on my containers, and, fingers-crossed, everything should be where we want it to be!</p>

<p><br>
<a href="/img/dummy-site03.jpg"><img src="/img/dummy-site03-thumb.jpg" alt="dummy-site03"></a></p>

<p>Using a combination of floats and widths I created a basic layout for my dummy site, with everything sitting where I wanted it to, but, lacking any real style... Onwards and upwards!</p>
